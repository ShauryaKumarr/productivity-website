This is a website I created, which has the main functionality 
of being used for productivity.

Using Python and various libraries, with the main one being Drafter (a library
my university professor created), I was able to create a website that had 
three primary functions: a notes section, a timer section, and a
to-do list/task section.

Because of certain complications with how Drafter is written and what I personally wanted to do, there are a few 
aspects of this website that are not entirely optimal or able to function correctly. For my timer, I wanted to 
do a realtime timer that updated in live time, but do to certain constraints in Drafter,
such as the outputted data only being able to be strings, I was not able to create the timer I desired.
There are also other aspects of the website, such as the to-do section, that I would eventually like to
further update and increase functionality.

As I am still a novice programmer, I am open to any areas of advice, or suggestions
for this program or my programming in general. Thank you!
